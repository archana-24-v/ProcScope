# ProcScope â€” Terminal System Monitor (C++17, ncurses)

ProcScope is a lightweight terminal-based system monitor written in C++17.
It reads from the Linux `/proc` filesystem and displays:
- overall CPU and memory usage
- a live list of top processes (sorted by CPU usage)
- human-readable uptime, hostname, and current time
- optional CPU temperature if available on the host

Key features
- multithreaded background updater for smooth UI
- ncurses-based UI with improved layout and color highlights
- process filtering, JSON snapshot export, and in-UI process termination
- optional CPU temperature detection (skips gracefully if not present)
